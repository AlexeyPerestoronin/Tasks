/// @brief   Solve the task: implement the `findSubstring`-method of `Solution`-class
/// @details https://leetcode.com/problems/substring-with-concatenation-of-all-words/description/
/// You are given a string s and an array of strings words. All the strings of words are of the same length.
///
/// A concatenated substring in s is a substring that contains all the strings of any permutation of words concatenated.
/// For example, if words = ["ab","cd","ef"], then "abcdef", "abefcd", "cdabef", "cdefab", "efabcd", and "efcdab" are all concatenated strings. "acdbef" is not a concatenated substring because it is not the concatenation of any permutation of words.
/// Return the starting indices of all the concatenated substrings in s. You can return the answer in any order.
///
/// Example 1:
///   Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
///   Output: [0,9]
///   Explanation:
///     Since words.length == 2 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 6.
///     The substring starting at 0 is "barfoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
///     The substring starting at 9 is "foobar". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.
///     The output order does not matter. Returning [9,0] is fine too.
///
/// Example 2:
///   Input: s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword", words = ["word","good","best","word"]
///   Output: []
///   Explanation:
///     Since words.length == 4 and words[i].length == 4, the concatenated substring has to be of length 16.
///     There is no substring of length 16 is s that is equal to the concatenation of any permutation of words.
///     We return an empty array.
///
/// Example 3:
///   Input: s = "barfoofoobarthefoobarman", words = ["bar","foo","the"]
///   Output: [6,9,12]
///   Explanation:
///     Since words.length == 3 and words[i].length == 3, the concatenated substring has to be of length 9.
///     The substring starting at 6 is "foobarthe". It is the concatenation of ["foo","bar","the"] which is a permutation of words.
///     The substring starting at 9 is "barthefoo". It is the concatenation of ["bar","the","foo"] which is a permutation of words.
///     The substring starting at 12 is "thefoobar". It is the concatenation of ["the","foo","bar"] which is a permutation of words.
///
/// Constraints:
/// 1. 1 <= s.length <= 104
/// 2. 1 <= words.length <= 5000
/// 3. 1 <= words[i].length <= 30
/// 4. s and words[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
